# Metro Bike Share Insights: Navigating Data, Discovery, and Urban Mobility

## 🚀 Welcome to the Metro Bike Share Odyssey on GitHub!

Dive into the vibrant world of Los Angeles' bike-sharing system with the Metro Bike Share Insights project. This README guides you through our exploration of urban mobility data. The journey is divided into 6 insightful sections:

1. **Data Model**
2. **Daily and Seasonality Analysis**
3. **Trips Analysis**
4. **Exploring and Analyzing Fleet**
5. **Station Insights and Urban Dynamics-1**
6. **Station Insights and Urban Dynamics-2**

Let's begin!

Our journey starts with constructing a robust data model using Star Schema, data cleaning, and format unifying. We employed Common Table Expressions for efficient data handling and K-means clustering for insightful bike-sharing pattern analysis.

**GitHub Navigation:**

- **Importing and Cleaning**: SQL codes for trip and station data.
- **Data Processing**: Station and trip duration classification files.
- **Data Preparation for Analysis**: Joins tables for Tableau export.
- **Demographic Data**: Queries for demographic data addition.
- **Public Transportation Station Data**: JSON format public transportation data queries.
